				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<br />
				<p>For our final client meeting, we met with Alex, our main client. Overall, he was very impressed with how far
				we'd taken the initial concept. The features he enjoyed most were the idea of multi-touch control, the sliding
				drawer that kept the volume controls persistant, and the AutoEQ screen. He loves the idea behind AutoEQ and said
				he'd certaintly buy the app if we had it fully working.</p>
				<br />
				<p>Alex expressed some sadness at the limitations of the Droid X, mainly it's lack of more than 2 point multi-touch.
				He also said he would like a larger screen to work with if he had the choice. Luckily, with the new line of Android
				tablets coming out, it is no large feat to port our code over. He also had an issue with the pitch slider. Since
				it covers a relatively high range of pitches, Alex found it easy to make broad changes to the pitch, but difficult
				to change small values precisely. One suggestion for improving this would be to make the rabbit and the turtle clickable.
				Clicking would increment the pitch up or down one knotch, thus allowing for finer control.</p>
				<br />
				<p>Alex also didn't like the Toast notifications for
				beginners. He said that he didn't have any doubt as to what the icons meant, and was desperate to turn them off as
				fast as he could because he found them to be annoying. This was dissappointing to us, but he said that he often does this
				in many of his applications.</p>
				<br />
				<p><i>Almost all DJ applications do this to some extent. For example, when I first installed Ableton Live </i>[A
				popular laptop DJing application]<i>, It had this little box that took up a 1/16th of the screen with explaining
				what trivial controls did. I also immediately disabled that, so don't take it too hard.</i> -- Alex</p>
				<br />
				<p>The most important feedback we feel Alex left us with is that he feels that this project should <strong>not</strong>
				stop with the end of this class. He thinks that if we released a working version, we could not only make money off of,
				but also make many amature and professional DJs very happy with their smartphones.</p>
