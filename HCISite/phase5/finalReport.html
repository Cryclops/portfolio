				<h2>Problem Domain and Root Concept</h2>
				<br />
				<p>Even though today's DJs have a vast array of tools at their disposal, there is still room for innovation.</p>
				<br />
				<p>That's why, when we <a href="../phase1/rootConcept.html">started</a> our project, we wanted to develop a touch-based DJ system that would allow DJs
				to do their job more efficiently and creatively. We considered such 
				<a href="../phase2/activityList.html">possibilities</a> as a touch-based EQ-ing,
				a cloud-based library, and a new interface design. We developed our system to be as user-friendly as possible
				for our 
				<a href="../phase1/fieldStudies.html">stakeholders:</a> advanced DJs, novice DJs, as well as listeners.</p>
				<br />
				<p>We arrived at this root concept because we considered the numerous creative ways that a hand-held DJ device
				could help the DJ community. For example, a DJ with a handheld device, no longer confined to his bulky laptop,
				could be very effective.</p>
				<br />
				<h2>Requirement Analysis</h2>
				<br />
				<p>We interviewed a variety of stakeholders during our requirements analysis. Since we wanted our system to
				be usable by both advanced and novice DJs, we performed several
				interviews and gained valuable knowledge
				that helped us make many of our design decisions.</p>
				<br />
				<p>We interviewed:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="../phase1/data/listeners.pdf">Clients</a> with DJ expertise</li>
					<li><a href="../phase1/data/clients.pdf">Listeners</a> who enjoy DJing and would consider becoming DJs</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				<p>The clients provided to us key information that we used in our development.
				Among the most important findings from the client interviews were:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A DJ's library should contain more than just the currently popular tracks</li>
					<li>Improvisation should be easy to implement</li>
					<li>The DJ device should have mash-up creation software</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				<p>Likewise, the listener-type interviewees provided helpful insight such as:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Turntable effects are highly appealing</li>
					<li>Mash-up creation is crucial</li>
					<li>DJs tend to be stationary</li>
					<li>DJs should be careful not to play music too loudly</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				<h2>User Interface Design</h2>
				<br />
				<p>The first activity we wanted to support was for the user to be able to obtain music not hosted locally. This
				is commonly referred to as the "cloud". Since we developed AndroiDJ on a Droid X, a smartphone, we can use the phone's
				data connection to stream in music from the internet or other server space the user may own. This is a fairly simple
				idea, however it has not been implented on many other DJ applications.</p>
				<br />
				<p>The actual design of the cloud 
				<a href="../phase2/data/Library.pdf">interface</a> demanded a few simple features. The user needed to be able to browse or search
				for the desired music and select. The main issue we focused on was searching. The Droid X already has a dedicated search button,
				which brings the user up to a search bar, within any application. The next issue was to decide how the user should input their
				query. We considered textual input and vocal input. We decided against vocal since usually they would be using it inside a loud
				room with music playing. This would cause the voice recognition techology to malfunction. Thus, using the on screen keyboard
				was the more logical option. The only downside to this is that touch based keyboards often are prone to typing errors.</p>
				<br />
				<p>Visually, the search interface was trivial to design. We used the standard Android design principals to ensure that the
				user, likely being knowledgeable about their phone, would not be confusing when entering a query.</p>
				<br />
				<p>Our favorite part of AndroiDJ's interface is the
				<a href="../phase2/data/SlidingDrawer.pdf">"sliding drawer"</a>. The activity is simple: the user must have full control
				over the currently playing music all the time. This includes activities like playing/pausing, changing the volume, pitch, and
				pan. To make it persistant, we used one of Android's layouts named SlidingDrawer. The idea is that it behaves like the drawer of
				a desk. When closed, all that is exposed is the handle of the drawer. When open, the contents of the drawer are shown, as well as
				the handle. We made the handle always visible throughout our application, and as a result, the drawer and play controls could
				always be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_era2_Blq0">accessed</a>.</p>
				<br />
				<p>The contents of the drawer consist of buttons and sliders. A slider is a virtual representation of a physical hardware control
				that is prevalent on DJing tools. It consists of a handle that slides back and forth on a track, changing a value depending on
				its position within that track. We used
				<a href="images/dj2.png">sliders</a> for the volume, pitch, pan, and crossfade activities. However, pitch and pan
				are not typically controlled via a slider, but rather via a rotary knob. We decided against using a knob due to the clumsyness
				of a knob on a touch screen.</p>
				<br />
				<p>A completely new concept that we came up with for AndroiDJ was the
				<a href="../phase2/data/AutoEQ.pdf">AutoEQ</a> feature. Changing the equalization settings for
				a song (changing the volume of a range of frequencies) is a common activity among DJs, mainly with high-pass and low-pass filters.
				Typically, this activity is implemented using a rotary knob. We decided against this for several reasons. First, the rotary knobs
				are difficult to control on a touch screen. Second, they make automating EQ curves difficult since the DJ would always need to
				be touching the knob. The AutoEQ screen allows the DJ to
				<a href="../phase4/images/mock1.png">draw</a> in their own custom EQ curves via their finger. It is displayed
				via an intuitive screen that draws in a curve either the top or bottom shaded in. The shaded portion depects the range of
				frequencies that are allowed to pass, while the non-shaded indicates frequencies that are silenced. We feel that this is a truely
				exciting feature, because it allows for more complex effects than were previously possible before touch-based interaction!</p>
				<br />
				<p>Lastly, one common user interface theme we kept throughout our application is color unitiy. We assigned a blue color to the
				activie song, and a red color to the secondary song. Every control is color coordinated to ensure that there is no confusion
				on what control applies to which song. We also separated our controls to different sides of the screen, i.e. controls for the
				active song are always on the top or left, and controls for the secondary song are always to the right or bottom.</p>

				<br />
				<h2>Evaluation and Redesign</h2>
				<br />
				<p>We used an empirical
				<a href="../phase4/evalResults.html">study</a> in which we observed and studied the users of our 
				design through field studies. To perform this study, we had 13 participants, all 
				aged 18-22 and in college.  10 of the participants were males, including our client,
				and the other 3 were females.  Based on a background questionnaire, all of our 
				participants knew what a DJ does.  For this study, we asked our particpants to perform
				a set of four relatively simple tasks.  But, we asked them to perform each task with our 
				application as well as the Android Standard Music Application, to compare the two and see
				how our application measured up to the already-marketed standard music application.</p>
				<br />
				<p>We had our participants perform each of our tasks, and we averaged the results for 
				each. To measure each task, we had our participants fill out a questionnaire and we asked 
				them rate their frustration level.  We also took down the number of mistakes made as well 
				as the time taken to complete the task.  The results we got were the following:</p>
				<br />
				<ul>
					<li>The level of frustration for each task was relatively the same, except for Task 3: 
					Changing the EQ Settings, where our application was much less frustrating.</li>
					<li>Again, the time taken for each task was relatively the same, except for Task 3, 
					where our App took much less time.</li>
					<li>Finally, the mistakes made for each task was related to the time taken, and in Task 
					3, our App had less mistakes made.</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				<p>Our application definitely measured up to the standard music application in each task.  
				It performed a lot better when our participants had to change to AutoEQ settings.  We made 
				this very easy to perform in our App, and it is very hard to find in the standard music
				application.</p>
				<br />
				<p>Based on our evaluation, we realized that we needed to focus on a few usability issues.  
				If we look at the results of our application alone, we can see that our application was not 
				perfect.  There were a few things we could improve on, and that was exactly what we did in our 
				redesign.  Here is a list of the three main changes we made in the redesign:</p>
				<br />
				<h3>1.&nbsp Playlist Control and Movement</h3>
				<br />
				<p>When creating our playlist, we want our DJs to be able to rearrange their playlist on the fly.  So, we have 
				decided to add a "drag and drop" feature.  Before, we could only add a song to playlist and then we would have 
				to individually move each song around to get it into the spot we wanted.  Now, with the "drag and drop," we can 
				get a song from our library and place it anywhere in the playlist.</p>
				<br />
				<h3>2.&nbsp Button Size</h3>
				<br />
				<p>One of our participants commented after his evaluation and said that the buttons were too small and that 
				because he had big hands, he accidentally hit the wrong button which took him to a separate part of the application.
				So we implmented bigger buttons.  We had space on our display screen to do so, so we used most of the space we could.
				Now the buttons are bigger, which will lead to less confusion.</p>
				<br />
				<h3>3.&nbsp Added Affordances</h3>
				<br />
				<p>Based on our results from our evaluation, we noticed that our participants had a little trouble figuring out 
				what the Automation and Equalizer features did. So, to solve this problem, we added a simple description of what
				each feature does so the DJ would know how to use it and what it does.</p>
				<br />
				<h2>Reflection on the Product</h2>
				<br />
				<p>Looking back to our root concept, our final product meets all of the requirements we set out to meet.
				We wanted our product to be a unique touch-based system that allows DJs to do their job efficiently, 
				as well as opening up new possibilities; such as touch-based EQ-ing, a cloud-based library, and a new 
				interface design. Our product allows DJs to do these things and much more.</p>
				<br />
				<p>In terms of usability, we feel that our product is extremely usable.  That was one of the main issues 
				we addressed when developping this product.  Our product displays simplicity and ease of use, which will 
				be very handy when a DJ is on stage and has to move a mile a minute to make sure everything is perfect.
				We also feel like our product is very useful, as well as usable.  Whether a person is a DJ or just a 
				music-lover, our product allows its users to simply listen to music all the way to creating mash-ups and 
				changing the AutoEQ settings.  It's useful for anybody.</p>
				<br />
				<p>All in all, our product is usable, useful, and very cutting-edge.  It is exactly what technology market 
				is looking for.  Granted, there are a few barriers in our design, but these barriers are not anything we 
				could not get through if we had more than a semester to work on it.  We need more time to make our design
				perfect.  We would need to add a help screen and an options screen, and other screens of that sort so our
				design is marketable.  But, overall, our design and final product would be a nice piece of software to own
				for anyone.</p>
				<br />
				<h2>Reflection on the Process</h2>
				<br />
				<p>Looking back at each phase of the scenario-based design process, we wouldn't change a thing about how we 
				designed our system.  The Requirements Analysis phase was useful for getting information on current products. 
				Writing scenarios about the current practice allowed us to see the current products in a real-world story.  
				We got to see what we needed to improve on.</p>
				<br />
				<p>That's where the Activity and Information Design phases came in.  We developed a list of activities 
				(features) that we thought our design needed.  We created metaphors to further explain why we needed these 
				activities.  Then we implemented our new activites into our scenarios, so we could see how they would work 
				in the real world.  After this, we thought about how we would physically add these features to our design.
				Most of our design includes buttons, sliders, and text.  But we needed to think about how everything would 
				be laid out.  So we developed sketches so we could see everything in our design.  And once we had our sketches,
				we could start building our prototype.</p>
				<br />
				<p>We then moved on to the Interaction Design phase, which included our first prototype.  But first, we had to 
				think of each of our buttons and sliders in terms of the four interaction design principles: affordances, good 
				mappings, feedback, and constraints.  We listed out each of our features and thought about how we could make 
				each one easier to understand and easier to use (more usable).  We added symbols and descriptive text boxes to 
				aid in our design.  And finally, we built our first prototype.</p>
				<br />
				<p>The last thing we needed to do was to evaluate our prototype.  We used an empirical study and had our 
				participants got through a series of tasks, in which we compared our application with the Android Standard Music 
				Application. The results can be found in Phase 4, but overall, our application measured quite well in comparison
				to the music application.  With this information, we redesigned our interface with a few changes to better our
				design.  And finally, we had our final product.</p>
				<br />
				<p>In summary, the scenario-based design process was lengthy, but was definitely needed. It allowed us as 
				designers to thoroughly develop a product, making sure that we did not leave anything out, that there was no 
				leaf unturned, and that no mistake were made.  It is as close to a full proof process that there will ever be, 
				and we feel that our final product is essentially "perfect."</p>
