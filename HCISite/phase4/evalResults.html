				<h2>Participants</h2>
				<br />
				<p>In our evaluation, we tried to get a diverse population to participate in our study. We wanted our 
				participants to have similar music preferences to keep our study controlled. Most of our data came from 
				college students aged 18-22.  In total, we had 13 participants take part in our study.  Of those 13 
				students, here is a breakdown of how they were characterized:</p>
				<br />
				<ul>
					<li>There were 10 males and 3 females</li>
					<li>2 of the participants aspired to be a DJ, and the rest did not</li>
					<li>All of the participants owned a MP3 player or an iPod</li>
					<li>12 of the participants listen to music everyday, and 1 listens weekly</li>
					<li>All of the participants had at least a basic concept of what a DJ does during a performance (based on 
					the written responses by our participants</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				<p>Luckily, we did not have to drop any of our results due to the fact that our questionnaires and tasks
				were relatively simple.</p>

				<h2>Results</h2>
				<br />
				<h3>Level of Frustration for Each Task</h3>
				<br />
				<p>Here we have a graph of out resulting data. We averaged our 13 participants's ratings and graphed the 
				standard music application versus our AndroiDJ application.  Overall, our graph shows that in each task,
				our AndroiDJ application was about the same or less frustrating to use than the standard music application.</p>
				<br />
				<center><img src="docs/frustrationGraph.jpg" height="300px" width="600px" /></center>
				<br />
				<p>During this evaluation, we wanted to see how our AndroiDJ stood against the standard music application.  We 
				did realize that the standard music app was less frustrating for two of the four tasks, but not by enough to be 
				noticable.  Overall, our AndroiDJ did very well against the standard music app.</p>
				<br />
				<p><center>____________________________________________________________________________________________</center></p>
				<br />		
				<br />			
				<h3>Time Taken to Complete Task</h3>
				<br />
				<p>We have another graph below.  This graph shows the average time taken (in seconds) by all the participants 
				to do each task	for both the standard music application and our AndroiDJ.  For the most part, our AndroiDJ 
				was very similar to the standard music application in all but one task.  In the changing the EQ settings task, 
				our AndroiDJ did substantially better than the music app.  Our application allows the user to quickly find the 
				EQ settings and change them while it takes a bit of time to find the AutoEQ settings.</p>

				<br />			
				<h3>Mistakes Made for Each Task</h3>
				<br />
				<p>We have another graph below.  This graph shows the average number of mistakes made by all of the participants
				in each task. Similar to the time taken graph, the biggest difference occurs in Task 3, where the participants 
				made a considerable amount of mistakes  in the standard music application.  This is probably due to a lack of
				familiarity with the standard music application.  The participants made less mistakes 
				with our AndroiDJ app.  Also, for the rest of the tasks, our AndroiDJ matched the standard music app for the 
				amount of mistakes made which is a good thing.</p>

				<h2>Usability Problems</h2>
				<br />
				<p>After conducting our evaluation, we were very pleased to see how our AndroiDJ application's interface stood up to the
				Standard Music Application.  Overall, it performed as well, if not better, than the standard music app's interface.  But 
				now, we need to look at our AndroiDJ individually rather than in comparison to another application.  We noticed 
				a few usability problems when conducting our evaluation.  They are listed here:</p>
				<br />
				<ul>
					<li>In all four tasks, the frustration level averages out to about a 2.3, which means that our participants
					were still somewhat frustrated with our design.  So if we look at our evaluation goals, our application's Ease
					of Use is not totally achieved.  We need to go back to our prototype and improve the ease of use of our design.
					That may include adding affordances, constraints, better feedback, or better mappings.
					Severity Estimate: 3</li>
					<br />
					<li>In all four tasks, there were mistakes made in our AndroiDJ application.  There wern't many mistakes but 
					enough that we need to go back and look at our design.
					Severity Estimate: 2. One of our participants said it best in our "Additional
					Comments" section of our Post-Test Questionnaire:</li>
					<ul>
						<li><i>"When I was trying to complete [the task], I accidentally hit one of the wrong buttons because it was close 
						to the correct button and it threw me off because it did something I didn't expect.  Maybe if you could spread
						the buttons out a little more, less incorrect button hitting would occur." </i>(Statement made by Particpiant 4)</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				<br />
				<br />
				<p>Based on these Usability issues, we will stop and take a look at our original design.  We will look at this evaluation
				and decide what to improve.  There is room for improvement based on the evaluation we performed because our participants
				had some level of frustration, it took them a little bit of time to figure out how to perform each task, and our 
				participants made some mistakes.  So using this data we will look to improve our prototype and make the necessary
				changes to better our evaluation statistics.</p>
