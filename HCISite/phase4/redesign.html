					<h2>Changes to the Interface</h2>
					<br />
					<p>Based on the study results, there are a few changes we needed to make to our design.  They are listed here,
					in order of importance. In each listing, you will find the change we need to make, the reason for the change,
					and the cost and benfit for doing so. Also, we discussed these changes with our client, and below is his input
					on why we should implement these changes.</p>
					<br />
					<br />
					<h3>1.&nbsp Playlist Control and Movement</h3>
					<br />
					<p>When creating our playlist, we want our DJs to be able to rearrange their playlist on the fly.  So, we have 
					decided to add a "drag and drop" feature.  Before, we could only add a song to playlist and then we would have 
					to individually move each song around to get it into the spot we wanted.  Now, with the "drag and drop," we can 
					get a song from our library and place it anywhere in the playlist.</p>
					<br />
					<p><b><i>Client's Note</i></b></p>
					<p>Our client agreed with our change.  He liked the fact that now he can add a song to the playlist to the second 
					position in order to play it quickly. He told us that DJs are always moving songs around in their playlist, so
					being able to do this quickly and easily is an added benefit.</p>
					<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					<h3>2.&nbsp Button Size</h3>
					<br />
					<p>One of our participants commented after his evaluation and said that the buttons were too small and that 
					because he had big hands, he accidentally hit the wrong button which took him to a separate part of the application.
					So we implmented bigger buttons.  We had space on our display screen to do so, so we used most of the space we could.
					Now the buttons are bigger, which will lead to less confusion.</p>
					<br />
					<p><b><i>Client's Note</i></b></p>
					<p>Our client again agreed with our change.  He also told us that, when a DJ is performing, he/she has so much on his 
					mind that he/she doesn't want to worry about pushing the right button.  He/She should be able to just push the right button
					and know it's the correct button.</p>
					<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					<h3>3.&nbsp Added Affordances</h3>
					<br />
					<p>Based on our results from our evaluation, we noticed that our participants had a little trouble figuring out 
					what the Automation and Equalizer features did. So, to solve this problem, we added a simple description of what
					each feature does so the DJ would know how to use it and what it does.</p>
					<br />
					<p><b><i>Client's Note</i></b></p>
					<p>Our client did not agree with us on this change.  He stated that all DJs should know what Automation and Equalizing
					are and that we shouldn't need to explain to them what each feature does.  So we listened to our client, and instead of
					explaining what the feature does, we only explain how to use the feature.  This is an added benefit for a new user that
					has never used an Android cell phone before.</p>
