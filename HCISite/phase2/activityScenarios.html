				<h2>Activity Scenario #1</h2>
					<p>The night of the party rolls around, and Dave is on stage setting up his equipment.  Joe has
					all the speakers set up around the dance floor, and Dave connects his equipment to his phone with
					AndroiDJ, a new Android DJ application. He will control the
					music from his cell phone.  Now, Dave came prepared.  Even though he had another tough week 
					of classes, Dave found time create a playlist of about 5 hours’ worth of music that he would
					play that night.  With his new software, he could play one song after another in 
					his playlist and even two songs at once in mash-up form, as well as controlling the volume 
					and the frequency of each song.</p>
					<br />
					<p> Hundreds of people start showing up to the party, and Dave starts playing his music. But, what
					Dave wanted to do was to take requests from the audience.  So he walked around the party and 
					added each requested song to the end of his playlist.  He had most of the requested songs in 
					his library but he noticed that he had been getting the same request from many of the sorority 
					girls at the party, “Party in the USA” by Miley Cyrus. Dave knew he didn’t have this song in his library, but 
					he was able to found the song on Youtube, stream it into his software program and play it next <a href="activityClaims.html">(1)</a>. 
					When the girls hear the song, they go wild.  By the middle of the song, the girls start hearing
					a little audio interference.  Dave had to explain to the girls that this song was streamed and 
					the sound quality isn’t as good as it could be if he had the song in his library.  But the 
					explanation goes longer than expected and the music suddenly stops playing.  Dave forgot to 
					play another song from the requested list.  However, Dave doesn’t panic as he quickly grabs his cell
					phone from his pocket and hits the play button <a href="activityClaims.html">(2)</a>.  A song starts playing, only what Dave doesn’t 
					realize is that when he put his phone back in his pocket, he accidentally changed the frequency 
					of the song.  So what was supposed to be a well-known Dave Matthews Band song actually sound like
					something a chipmunk would sing.  Dave is at first quite confused, since he hasn't used this feature
					before, but soon finds the correct button and fixes this problem and the party continues <a href="activityClaims.html">(3)</a>.  Dave
					is a huge hit.  Everyone loves his DJ-ing skills.</p>

				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>Our previous Problem Scenario became this Action Scenario by introducing some of our proposed activities
				to the scenario. The introduced activities were the cloud-based library, the play-listing ability, and pitch-shifting.
				The newly introduced activities feature a large upside, but they are not without downsides. The cloud-based music library
				makes previously unavailable music available, but at the cost of sound quality. The pitch-shifting feature is nice, but
				for an inexperienced user like Dave, it is a somewhat unplesant suprise.</p>

				<h2>Activity Scenario #2</h2>
					<p>Suppose that Alex is at a party where a DJ is providing music. The DJ plays 
					several popular tracks and everyone is having a great time. Then the DJ plays 
					a "mash-up," which is a blend of two songs. In the mash-up, the melody of one 
					track is played over the underlying rhythm and beat of another song. Created 
					using sophisticated software, this mash-up effect is highly pleasing to the 
					audience. While traditional DJs simply play tracks sequentially, the DJ at this 
					party added to the audience's enjoyment by playing a mash-up, or a blend of two
					songs. While this is cool, it requires a more skilled DJ. On a few of this DJ's songs,
					he made mash-ups that did not sound good at all <a href="activityClaims.html">(1)</a>.
					Also, what we didn't know about this DJ was that he had to spend far more time preparing
					for his performance than the other DJ <a href="activityClaims.html">(2)</a></p>
				</div>
				<br />
				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>The problem scenario described Alex's disappointment in the DJ's inability to 
					play mash-ups of contemporary songs.  This activity scenario addresses this issue
					by providing the DJ with software that allows the creation of mash-ups. Although 
					the DJ in the activity scenario has more software and thus would take more time 
					to get set up than would a traditional DJ, the interesting effects of mash-ups are
					well worth the trouble because audiences enjoy mash-ups.</p>
