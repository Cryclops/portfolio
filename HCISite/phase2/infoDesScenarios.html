				<h1>Information Design Scenarios</h1>
				<br />
				<h2>Scenario #1</h2>
				<br />
				<div id="whiteBox">
					<p>[Background on Dave and Joe can be found in the <a href="activityScenarios">earlier scenarios</a>.]</p>
					<br />
					<p>The night of the party rolls around, and Dave is on stage setting up his equipment.  Joe has all
					the speakers set up around the dance floor, and Dave syncs up his new AndroiDJ, the newest Android 
					cell phone DJ software, to the speakers. He will control the music from his cell phone.  Now, Dave 
					came prepared.  Even though he had another tough week of classes, Dave found time create a playlist 
					of about 5 hours' worth of music that he would play that night.  With his new software on his phone, 
					Dave had his list of songs queued up in his playlist ready to go.  The first song was ready to play, 
					and the next song was <a href="data/Queue.pdf">"on-deck."</a></p>
					<br />
					<p>Hundreds of people start showing up to the party, and Dave starts playing his music. But, what 
					Dave wanted to do was to take requests from the audience.  So he walked around the party and added 
					each requested song to the end of his <a href="data/Queue.pdf">playlist</a>.  He had most of the requested songs in his library 
					but he noticed that he had been getting the same request from many of the sorority girls at the party, 
					"Party in the USA" by Miley Cyrus. Dave knew he didn't have this song and decided to find the song 
					on Youtube using the searching feature. He hit the search icon and used his on-screen keyboard to type in
					the song information that he know. Dave had big fingers, so he misspelled a few words. Luckily, these
					were auto-corrected for him <a href="infoDesClaims.html">(1)</a>. He then streamed it into his cell
					phone, and played it next.  When the girls hear the song, they 
					go wild.  Dave knew that the song was streamed and that it would have a little audio interference.  
					So Dave decided to use his software to make the song sound a lot better.  He used the <a href="data/AutoEQ.pdf">AutoEQ</a> button
					and EQ'ed his song, masking the bad quality with an automated low-pass filter. Although this is an
					advance technique, Dave was able to use it quite easily, as the interface allowed him to draw in
					his automations using his finger <a href="infoDesClaims.html">(2)</a>. Dave was pleased to find that his automations behaved exactly as
					he expected, even with only a little experience.  But as Dave was playing with
					the automation, he forgot to play another song from the requested list.  Dave doesn't panic as he 
					quickly hits the back button and then swipes up a <a href="data/SlidingDrawer.pdf">"drawer"</a> to expose the play controls.  A song starts playing.  Dave then makes 
					sure all of his songs are lined up the way he wants them to be, swiping the "drawer" down to hide the controls.
					That way he can't accidentally hit a button to mess up the sound, yet has smooth and fast access
					to important controls <a href="infoDesClaims.html">(3)</a>.  Dave is a huge hit.  Everyone loves his DJ-ing skills.</p>
				</div>
				<br />
				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>This scenario reflects Information Design in that Dave is able to more easily accomplish his tasks due to
				the new user interface. Using the on-screen keyboard is much more appropriate in a DJing situation than, say,
				voice recognition, which would get blotted out in the noise. Having Dave naviguate through complex menu's in the
				cloud would be much too demanding, since there are millions of artists to choose from.</p>
				<br />
				<p>The AutoEQ feature is also quite an appropriate use of the touch-screen. With it, Dave is able to visually express
				what he wants to hear. His actions are backed up by color and actual audio confirmation. With a small learning curve,
				Dave is a master of a feature that is usually only a characteristic experienced DJ's possess.</p>
				<br />
				<h2>Scenario #2</h2>
				<br />
				<div id="whiteBox">
					<p>Consider again Alex is at a party where a DJ is providing music. The DJ plays several popular
					tracks and everyone is having a great time. Then the DJ plays a "mash-up". Using the multitouch
					playback <a href="data/SlidingDrawer.pdf">controls</a>, he is able to change the volume of one song, while changing the pitch. This
					creates a very popular building "swoop" sound effect that the audience loves. The DJ was also
					able to use this effect to help the terrible sounding "mash-ups". He could leave one song at a low
					volume while quickly finding the appropriate pitch to match the beat perfectly to the other song <a href="infoDesClaims.html">(1)</a>.
					This led to less obvious and shorter-lived embarassments. In addition to the multitouch volume/pitch
					combination, he also changes the volume/pan. This is traditionally done using a 2D graph, but since
					he is able to control each variable with an independant finger, he is able to achieve a rotary effect
					that isn't commonly heard. However, he is sweaty, and often messes up the precise touch needed to effectively
					control the screen <a href="infoDesClaims.html">(2)</a>. Even with the mistakes, this unique sound makes him even more enjoyable to Alex.</p>
				</div>
				<br />
				<h3>Discussion</h3>
				<p>In the Activity Scenario, the DJ enjoyed the new features, but ended up making mistakes with them. He picked
				two songs that didn't go together very well. Even though he attempted to match the beats, having both songs
				at the same volume made the mistake very obvious and embarassing. Being able to control the pitch and the volume for
				the song he was trying to bring in was very helpful. To his expectant ear, he could make the changes before his
				less attentive audience could really pick up on them. Also, even though the DJ had the panning feature available in
				the Activity Scenario, he wasn't able to utilize it in a new way until the multitouch interface came along.</p>
