				<h1>Activity List</h1>
				<br />
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Ability to create Mash-ups:</strong> This activity will allow the DJ/user to play two
					songs at a time. A lot of DJ’s today are creating “mash-ups,” which means taking two songs and
					playing one over the other, creating a new sound.  This activity will allow us to do that.
					It will also allow the DJ/user to have a song “on-deck” for when the first song finishes.
					The DJ can then fade out from the first and into the second song, making the transition smoother.</li>
					<li><strong>Music Cloud:</strong> This activity will allow the DJ/user access to any song possible.
					This music cloud is a database similar to Youtube, where DJ’s can stream songs not in their own
					library, into their interface. It allows the user to be able to meet every single request by the
					audience if he or she so chooses. DJ’s today only play what is in their library, but if an audience
					member has a request not in the DJ’s library, he or she can get the song.</li>
					<li><strong>Change the Volume:</strong> This is a very standard activity that is a must-have in an
					interface. Changing the volume allows the user to make each song louder or quieter depending on
					the audience’s preference.</li>
					<li><strong>Changing the Pitch:</strong> This is also a very standard activity on a DJ interface.
					Changing the pitch or frequency allows the user to “play” with the song. He can speed the song
					up, or slow it down for a nice effect.</li>
					<li><strong>Song Information:</strong> We think this feature would be valuable since a DJ picks
					his next song based on several very tangible properties, along with a few intangible. We thought
					it would be nice to give the DJ information they need, such as Song, Artist, Album, BPM, Genre,
					Key, and a few customizeable attributes.</li>
					<li><strong>Automation:</strong> Giving the DJ a few macro-like actions could speed up their workflow,
					as well as freeing up their mind for more creative endevours.</li>
					<li><strong>Sound Effects:</strong> Many of our interviewees said that effects such as hits, builds,
					and fades were essential to grabbing the audiences attention. We plan to include a set, as well as
					having the ability to add custom sounds. The interface should be quick and spur-of-the-moment.</li>
					<li><strong>Equalizer:</strong> Along the same rationale as Sound Effects, the ability to control a
					song's frequency range also allows for grabbing the audience's attention. It is a popular effect
					throughout the industry.</li>
					<li><strong>Pan Control:</strong> Independant control of a song's panning is also a popular effect
					used to grab the audience's attention. This will be a dial-like widget that controls how much sound
					is in each (L/R) speaker.</li>
					<li><strong>Smart Library:</strong> If we're going to detect BPM and pitch, it would be wise to keep
					this information in the library for later use. The library will be sortable by any of these parameters.</li>
					<li><strong>Song Queuing:</strong> This feature will give the DJ the option of pre-composing a list of songs
					to play, thus freeing some time for himself.</li>
