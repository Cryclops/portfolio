				<h1>Problem Scenarios</h1>
				<br />
				<h2>Scenario #1</h2>
				<div id="whiteBox">
					<p>Dave is an up-and-coming DJ. He attends his university during the week, and goes through a grueling
					schedule, taking 24 credits. So on the weekends, he enjoys taking a break from school work and DJ-ing
					at local establishments. It’s Dave’s favorite thing to do, and he’s become pretty good at it.
					Dave has a good friend named Joe, who is the president of his fraternity, Mu Sigma Nu.
					Joe calls Dave one day and says that he wants to throw the biggest frat party this university has ever
					seen, and he wants Dave to be the DJ. Obviously Dave is ecstatic, he can finally show off his talent.</p>
					<br />
					<p>The night of the party rolls around, and Dave is on stage setting up his equipment. Joe has all the
					speakers set up around the dance floor, and Dave connects his equipment to his laptop which will rest
					on a table towards the back of the stage. Now, Dave came prepared. Even though he had another tough week
					of classes, Dave found time create a playlist of about 5 hours’ worth of music that he would play that
					night. He was using his normal software, which allowed him to play one song after another in his playlist.
					He could control the volume and the speed of the song (BPM).</p>
					<br />
					<p>Hundreds of people start showing up to the party, and Dave starts playing his music. But, what Dave
					wanted to do was to take requests from the audience. So he walked around the party and wrote down the
					requests from different people. He noticed that he had been getting the same request from many of the
					sorority girls at the party, “Party in the USA” by Miley Cyrus. Dave immediately feels bad because he
					is a guy, and doesn’t have that song in his library. A lot of the girls come up to him and tell him
					to play that song, but he regretfully turns them down. About half of the girls leave the party.
					Joe then calls Dave over and asks him why the girls left and he explains himself. But the explanation
					goes longer than expected and the music stops playing.  Dave forgot to play another song from the
					requested list. Dave runs back over to his laptop, which with all of the people around takes a while.
					He plays another song, but a lot of the people are mad at him and start to leave.
					Dave is left on stage with no audience.</p>
				</div>
				<br />
				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>This scenario outlines the problems of having a locally stored music library. Dave's problem is fairly
				realistic. It is more than common for an amature DJ to not have the appropriate songs for his listener
				group, as he is generally unsure of what to expect.</p>
				<br />
				<h2>Scenario #2</h2>
				<div id="whiteBox">
					<p>One weekend, Alex went to a restaurant where there was a DJ playing loud music. This DJ did not
					have a lot of equipment - all of his gear fit in his compact car. Alex was having a good time, but
					she noticed that the DJ did not have a turntable. Moreover, she did not hear any mash-ups the entire
					night. While the DJ played good music that evening, Alex felt that the DJ could have made the night
					more interesting if he had used a turntable and played mash-ups of current popular hip-hop songs.</p>
				</div>
				<br />
				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>This scenario tackles it from the listener's end. It highlights the value of the DJ's skill to improvise.
				This is inspired by the data collected from the listeners. They often expressed boredom if the DJ wasn't dynamic
				and inspiring</p>
