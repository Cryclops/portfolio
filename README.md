# portfolio

This is just a nice place where my portfolio site lives. Feel free to poke around. It's built with:

* [bootstrap-sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass)
* [Compass](http://compass-style.org/)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [SmoothAnchors](https://github.com/alextrob/SmoothAnchors)
* PHP

# How to build

1. Get bootstrap-sass
  * Install node.js
  * From npm, install Bower
  * Run "bower install" from the project root (this will do the right things because of the bower.json file)
2. Get something to build Sass
  * I use [Koala](http://koala-app.com/), thus the koala-config.json file
  * You'll only need to build /scss/main.scss
3. Get something to run PHP
  * I happen to use [WampServer](http://www.wampserver.com/en/)
