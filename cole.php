			<h3>Cole Wedding</h3>
			<p><em>Spring 2011</em></p>
			<p><a href="http://cryclops.com/temp/Cole/third.html"
			target="_blank">Site</a></p>
			<br />
			<p>This was made in Flash CS3. The Cole's approached me to see if I
			could help them make something to go along with their wedding
			invitation. We ended up agreeing on a website with the details that
			wouldn't fit on the invitation.</p>
			<br />
			<p>From what they described, I could tell they wanted something
			that resembled other Flash websites they had seen. Normally, I try
			my best to avoid using Flash due to the device support issues.
			However, considering the animations they wanted, I determined that
			learning and implementing with Flash would be faster than learning
			the similar HTML/CSS/Javascript methods.</p>
			<br />
			<p>The Cole's gave me a list of the things they'd like to include,
			and I categorized the information into the "W" categories at the
			top of the page. Using some wedding photos, I believe I achieved a
			very clean look.</p>

			<p>It took ~12 hours to learn Flash (ActionScript 3.0) and develop
			the site</p>
