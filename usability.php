                    I worked with two other students at the University of Washington evaluate
                    the usability of a digital parental control system, still in the early
                    prototyping stages. We created a paper prototype from the mockups our
                    client supplied and conducted a usability study with them. I acted as
                    a moderator and notetaker.

                    I created this infographic to provide a quick summary to our client, with
                    more rich information in a written report.
