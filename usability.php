                    I worked with two students at
                    <a href="http://www.washington.edu/" target="_blank">UW</a>
                    to evaluate a digital parental control system for Intel. We created
                    a paper prototype from the mockups our
                    client supplied and conducted a usability study with them. I acted as
                    a moderator and notetaker.

                    I created this infographic to provide a quick summary to our client, with
                    more rich information in a written report.

                        Note: to honor a confidentiality agreement with our client, the infographic
                        omits some information and graphics.
