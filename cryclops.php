		<h3>Cryclops</h3>
		<p><em>Fall 2010</em></p>
		<p><a href="http://cryclops.com" target="_blank">Site</a></p>
		<br />
		<p>Cryclops is a 'brand' that I launched my Android apps from. My idea
		was to have a place where:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Users could find more information (short of creating a
			forum).</li>
			<li>I could share my thoughts on design and development.</li>
			<li>I could have more of a Google presence than just on the Android
			Market.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I knew that a CMS was probably the right way to go, and after
		checking out its competitors, I decided Wordpress was the best CMS for
		the job. As far as I could tell, it was easier to setup out of the box
		than Drupal and had better plugins than Joomla!.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Bending the Wordpress framework to get a
		custom look and feel was a challenge. I had to learn about
		<a href="http://themeshaper.com/forums/topic/how-to-change-the-look-of-thematic-with-a-wordpress-child-theme"
		target="_blank">Thematic child themes</a> and plugin integration as well
		as icon design. Although I've had art classes when I was younger, using
		Photoshop and getting clean icons was a new challenge. I had a lot of
		fun learning all that, and you can find some thoughts on logo design
