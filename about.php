		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<br />
		<p>I currently work at Microsoft in Redmond, WA, and study User-Centered Design at
        the University of Washington's <a href="http://www.hcde.washington.edu/" target="_blank">HCDE program</a>.
        At work, I've had the unique opportunity to be involved in the design, development, and testing
        of the latest generation of Microsoft Word.</p>
		<br />
		<p>I care deeply about how to craft high quality products that are intuitive to use.
        This has led me to enjoy studying and using a variety of design and software methodologies. To name a
        few, lately I've been practicing UCD, Agile, MVVM, and data-driven design.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Some background on me -- I grew up in Annapolis, MD. I love the
		water, and have been sailing for most of my life. In recent years, I got
		into surfing and
		<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/8263226@N08/sets/72157621706828547/" target="_blank">kiteboarding</a>,
		but I love hiking, biking, climbing, and most other outdoor
		activities.</p>
		<br />
		<p>I've also been interested in music and video creation for most of
		my life. I started playing guitar in middle school and have since
		moved on into exploring audio/video applications such as:
		<ul>
			<li>Reason</li>
			<li>Ableton Live</li>
			<li>Logic</li>
			<li>After Effects</li>
			<li>Premiere</li>
			<li>Final Cut</li>
		</ul>
		I still play with all of these in my free time, and you can see a light
		portfolio I put together a few years ago
